Project 1: Tokenizer
====================

This project was my first lab from Arch1 class. This was named "Tokenizer". The function of this project is to store individual words that user inputs and store the history of inputs into a linkedList.

## How to compile it:

To compile the program is neccessary to use the next commands:

```shell
> make  
> make run 
```

Once done this the program will run and it will be asking the user for a phrase to enter:

```shell
> Hello World Forever! 
```

After entering the desired phrase the tokenizer will start and will print all its content:

```shell
> Hello
> World
> Forever!
```

Next, the input user is store in the history (linkedList) and print its content:

```shell
> ID: 1  
> Str: Hello 
> ID: 2  
> Str: World
> ID: 3  
> Str: Forever!
```

And finally the momory its released from the linkedList and the Tokenizer.
